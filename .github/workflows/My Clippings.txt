Broadly speaking, all financial transactions can be divided into those that bring money in and those that take money out. If money has come in, you now no longer have to choose out of four options to record it – you only have to choose between two: income or liability. If money goes out, choose between only two options – expense or asset.

Financial transactions flow through an organization like water in a river. If you stop and look around you, you will see production taking place, a customer’s cheque arriving, raw material being unloaded, the caterer waiting for payment and finished goods being shipped out. An instant snapshot of all this financial activity gives a Balance Sheet for that particular moment.

Suppose I buy something that lasts me 10 months. Is it an expense or an asset? b)   I now buy something else that lasts me 10 days. Would this be an expense or an asset? If we only look at life in the absolute sense, we might tend to call the item that lasts 10 days an expense and the one that lasts 10 months an asset. But can it be the other way around? Is it possible for the first item to be an expense and the second to be an asset? Yes, it is possible. Let us say we prepare our Balance Sheet on 31 December, and the item that lasts 10 months is purchased on 1 January. Since the life of the item is 10 months and the Balance Sheet is prepared 12 months later, this item will appear as an expense. Now suppose the one that lasts 10 days has been purchased on 27 December. Its life is only 10 days, but since the Balance Sheet is prepared four days later, this item will be listed as an asset. Life should be seen in the context of the date on which the Balance Sheet is prepared. Anything that outlives the Balance Sheet date is an asset.

If you cannot track consumption for the entire period, can you at least measure non-consumption on a single day? In accounts, by and large, we do not believe in plus and minus, but in debits and credits. 10,000 has been debited in the Profit & Loss Account, and if we wish to reduce it to 6,000, we must credit 4,000, and this is what we do. The figure 4,000 will now be shown on the incomes’ side of the Profit & Loss Account as closing inventory.

Now consider the situation in the following year. I have 4 tables lying in the warehouse. This year, I decide to purchase nothing. I manage to sell all 4 tables at the rate of 1,500 each. What is my profit in the second year? Have I really made a profit of 6,000? Surely not! Common sense once again comes to our rescue. My profit per table remains 500, so on a sale of 4 tables I must have made a profit of 2,000 and not 6,000. Where have we gone wrong this time? Though I did not purchase anything during this year, I have nevertheless consumed 4 tables. Let me re-emphasize – it is consumption and not spending which should be considered as an expense. So, how do we set things right? We can do so by listing the value of goods consumed under expenses. The closing inventory of last year will now, quite logically, appear as the opening inventory of this year.

Let us take another look at our Balance Sheet and calculate the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is 16.8 per cent. If sources cost this organization 16.8 per cent, then any investment in assets is justified only if a return of not less than 16.8 per cent per annum, or profits not less than 168 on an investment in assets worth 1,000, can be generated.

In the case of a manufacturing organization, cash is used to purchase inventory. The inventory then goes through a manufacturing process and gets converted to a finished product. When a sale is made, the finished goods inventory becomes debtors or receivables. On the due date, when collection is made from debtors, it gets converted to cash again. This cycle of cash-to-cash is called the working-capital cycle. Profitable organizations know that the key to success is to have a shorter working-capital cycle. Every attempt must be made to shorten this cycle.

Working capital requirement is thus the sum total of the money needed by enterprises to maintain inventory, hold on to a certain minimum cash balance and also be able to finance customers, in the sense that when goods are sold on credit the organization effectively assumes the role of a financier to the customer, lending goods instead of money. Current assets represent what is known as gross working capital. You may also be familiar with the expression net working capital. Net working capital is calculated as gross working capital less current liabilities.

As you have just seen, current liabilities play the role of reducing the working capital required to finance current assets. Out of a total requirement of 20 current assets, the organization managed to procure 10 on credit. So, it needed an infusion of only 10 from long-term sources. If, however, the organization had enjoyed a higher credibility amongst suppliers and vendors, perhaps it would have been possible to obtain credit to the extent of 15, in which case the net working capital requirement would have dropped further to 5. If the organization was able to command 20 (due to an immensely high standing), the need for working capital would disappear, and the organization would be functioning fully on others’ money. It follows, therefore, that the greater the credibility a firm enjoys, the lower would be its net working capital requirement. However, there is a trap in this. As current liabilities keep increasing, the working capital ratio becomes successively worse.

On the face of it, it appears that even though A and B have invested identical sums in their businesses and are running businesses with identical turnovers and expenses, the PAT (the profit that belongs to the owners) in the case of A is higher than that of B. Now look at the earnings per share. This is calculated as PAT divided by the total number of shares. You will see that A has an EPS of 22, but B’s EPS is 54! Even though B earns a lower PAT in absolute terms, you can see that it enjoys a substantially higher EPS. In other words, the owners of A have invested 1500,000 and earned 330,000, translating into a return on shareholders’ capital of 22 per cent. In the case of B, the percentage return on an investment of 500,000 works out to 54. The question that begs an answer: WHY? Let us find some answers. There are three reasons why B earns so much more than A. The first reason As we saw during our discussion of Rule I, owners’ capital is the most expensive source of capital. Borrowed funds are relatively cheaper. In the case of A, 75 per cent of the total funds have come from shareholders or owners, while B has taken only 25 per cent from this expensive source, and 75 per cent has come from a cheaper source. This makes B’s average cost of capital substantially lower than A’s. The PBIT generated is at the rate of 30 per cent. In B’s case, this means that B earns 30 per cent on 500,000 raised from shareholders. But B also earns 30 per cent on the borrowed 1500,000, on which it is obliged to pay just 10 per cent. This difference of 20 per cent also goes straight into B’s pocket. Therefore, B earns for its shareholders 30 per cent on 500,000 (shareholders’ contribution) as well as 20 per cent on 1500,000 (the borrowed investment), taking, in the process, the return on shareholders’ funds substantially higher.

The figures in the table show that when the fixed cost was zero, the profit increased from 20 in the first year to only 40 in the next year. Then, when the fixed costs were 20, the profit increased to 60. When the fixed costs were 40, the profit went up to 80. And when the fixed costs were the highest, the impact on profit was the most. When did profit increase the most? In the situation where the fixed costs were the highest.

Between A and B, who has borrowed more? B. Who pays more interest? B. Whose fixed-cost commitment is higher? B’s. Therefore, whose EPS is more? B’s B earns a substantially higher rate of return because of a higher fixed cost in its costing structure. B is committed to pay an annual interest of 150,000 as compared to 50,000 in the case of A, which, at first glance, is horrifying. However, this fact has resulted in B having an EPS or return on investment (ROI) which is two and a half times that of A. I must, however, warn you that the strategy of increasing fixed costs to increase profits is only recommended for good times, when markets are booming and the sales graph seems to be moving consistently upward. We should focus on increasing only those fixed costs which can also positively impact the top line. Only when the increased fixed costs lead to an increase in the sales figure will the profit increase disproportionately. When recession sets in, it is time to begin swapping the fixed costs with variable costs wherever possible. This is because when sales drop, the variable costs will also decrease, but the fixed costs will remain fixed. If the fixed cost component is high at such a time, it can lead to a drastic and disproportionate fall in profit.

Fixed Cost Fixed Cost = (Sales × PV Ratio) – Profit Fixed Cost = Contribution – Profit 3. Profit-Volume Ratio PV ratio shows the relationship between contribution and sales. Generally, it is expressed as a percentage. This ratio is also known as contribution-to-sales ratio. PV ratio remains the same for any number of units provided selling price and variable cost are the same. PV ratio can be calculated in two ways: 4. Break-Even Point This is the point at which there will be no profit and no loss. Sales in value will be equal to total cost and contribution will be equal to fixed cost. 5.

1. The first item is capital Bobby has introduced a capital of 100,000 in the business. As discussed above, this has brought money in and we need to choose between the account heads of income and liability when recording this in the Balance Sheet. As already discussed, this appears to be a liability (credit effect). What about the second effect? In what form did Bobby bring this capital? In cash. And where is this cash today? Globe Furniture is now in possession of cash of 100,000. This is an asset for Globe (debit effect). Please note, we didn’t think at all about debit and credit. But because the logic applied was correct, automatically we have recorded once each on the debit and credit side. 2. The second item is loan Globe Furniture has taken a loan of 150,000. Again, money has come in and this seems to be a liability (credit effect). And the second effect is that the cash in possession of the business has increased to 250,000 on the assets’ side (debit effect). 3. Land, building, machinery purchased for 175,000 Since this has taken money away, the choice is between assets and expenses. These look like assets. What about the second effect? If you have, instinctively, said ‘expense’, stop for a minute. If we record this item once as an asset and again as an expense, we would have recorded it twice on the debit side. I told you a while ago, in such situations re-examine the logic. Where are we going wrong? We have discussed that money spent is either an expense or an asset, not both. Since we are showing land, building, machinery (LBM) as assets, we cannot record them on the expenses, side again. The second effect is that out of a cash balance of 250,000, Globe Furniture has spent 175,000 and the cash left with them is 75,000, as shown on the assets’ side. Let us double-check how debit and credit have been recorded? When we put land, building, machinery on the assets’ side, we gave it a debit effect. And the credit was recorded by deducting the same amount from cash on the assets’ side. A negative on the debit side amounts to credit, remember? But have you noticed that we are not consciously doing it? Debit and credit are happening on their own. 4. Raw material of 60,000 purchased on payment of cash Money has gone out. Raw material seems be an expense (debit). The second effect will be a further reduction of cash balance to 15,000 (credit). 5. Raw material of 25,000 purchased on credit from Rita Purchase of raw material is an expense, as in the case of the previous transaction (debit). The total raw material purchased has now increased to 85,000. The difference is that in this case, money has not been paid so far, and material has been purchased on credit from Rita. Globe Furniture now owes 25,000 to Rita, who will appear as a creditor on the liabilities’ side (credit). 6. Manufacturing expenses paid – 5,000 This is an expense (debit). The second effect will be a reduction of cash on the assets’ side to 10,000 (credit). 7. Goods sold (in cash) – 75,000 Sales is income (credit effect). And it results in an increase in the cash balance on the assets’ side to 85,000 (debit effect). 8. Goods sold on credit to Neil – 50,000 Sales is still an income (credit). The only difference, in this case, is that money has not yet been received from Neil. The total sales have increased to 125,000. Neil owes 50,000 to Globe Furniture, and will appear as a debtor on the assets’ side (debit). 9. Interest paid to the bank at the rate of 10 per cent – 15,000 Interest paid is an expense (debit). It also results in a reduction of cash on the assets’ side, from 85,000 to 70,000 (credit). 10. Amount paid to Rita against goods purchased on credit – 23,500 Rita is appearing as a creditor on the liabilities’ side to the extent of 25,000. Now that 23,500 is paid, Globe Furniture owes Rita merely 1,500. So this payment will reduce the figure of creditor appearing as a liability (debit). And on the assets’ side it will also reduce the cash balance by 23,500 and bring it down to 46,500 (credit). 11. Amount received from Neil against goods sold on credit – 40,000 Similar to the previous transaction, Neil appears as a debtor on the assets’ side. Since 40,000 is received from him, Neil is now a debtor merely to the extent of 10,000. So, we should reduce the figure of the amount outstanding appearing against Neil’s name by 40,000 on the assets’ side (credit). It will increase the cash balance on the same side by 40,000 (debit), taking it to 86,500. Now, let us find out if Globe Furniture has made a profit or a loss. The total of the income is 125,000 and the total of the expenses is 105,000. Globe Furniture has made a profit of 20,000. The convention is to write the heavier figure on both the sides, since all financial statements need to be balanced. And the balancing figure is shown on the side which has a lesser total. So when an organization makes a profit, the figure must necessarily appear on the expenses’ side, since the total of expenses is lesser than the total of incomes. (Conversely, if it makes a loss, the figure is shown on the income side.) This profit needs to be transferred to the Balance Sheet. Where will profit be shown? On the assets’ or the liabilities’ side? Profit will be shown as a liability. Why should profit appear as a liability? Non-accounting persons will usually say that profit should be an asset. Well, I will give you two answers for why profit appears as a liability, one a technical and the other a common-sense answer. Technically speaking, is profit a debit or a credit balance? Non-accountants will sometimes instinctively say that profits represent a debit balance, since they observe that it is written on the debit side of the Profit & Loss Account. But a closer inspection will reveal that profit is a credit balance. The credit side of the Profit & Loss Account has a bigger total than the debit side. Profit, therefore, is a net credit. And it must accordingly appear on the credit side on a Balance Sheet, which is the liabilities’ side. The common-sense approach is that a business is started in order to make profit for the owners. The profit that a business makes belongs to the owners. And if the business has generated profit, and not yet distributed it amongst the owners, it is a liability for the business, since it owes this profit to them. Profit will be shown in a Balance Sheet under a description called ‘reserves’, appearing immediately after capital. (Just to set the record straight, in a proprietary concern or a partnership firm’s Balance Sheet, profit is usually added to capital. In a limited company’s Balance Sheet, it appears as reserves and surplus.) So let us transfer the profit of 20,000 as reserves on the liabilities’ side and see if the Balance Sheet balances. Voila! The Balance Sheet has balanced. And we have made it simple by applying the short-cut formula that I explained in this chapter. At the end of the book, I have given you one more case. It can be used by those of you interested in getting more familiar with making a Balance Sheet and a Profit & Loss Account using this method. The solution has also been provided for you to check the accuracy of your work.

The square root of 15 is 3.87. Adding the number 2 to the square root of 15 results in 5.87. (3.87 + 2). That result squared is 34.49. We can immediately learn two things from this exercise: One is that the whole numbers on the Square of Nine ignore decimals and will inherently create rounding errors; and the second is that adding 2 to the square root of a number and squaring the sum is the same thing as a 360 degree rotation up on the Square of Nine. Subtracting the number 2 from the square root of 15 and then squaring the difference would be the equivalent of a 360 degree rotation down on the Square of Nine.

March 12 low - 788.9 = (SQRT(788.9) + factor) ^2 180 degrees ( factor = 1) = 846.07 360 degrees (factor = 2) = 905.25 540 degrees (factor = 3) = 966.42 720 degrees (factor = 4) = 1029.60 Using the price scale of the chart you printed, draw four horizontal lines on the price chart at 846 through 1029, the price levels of the 180 degree rotations you just calculated, and you will have completed the horizontal gridlines. Calculating the Vertical Time Lines The vertical gridlines are the time element of the Roadmap. You calculate the time element by taking the square root of the starting price of 788.9. The result is 28.08 which rounds to 28. Using a compass, the increments on your straight edge, or by any other method, mark off the distance of 28 bars from the last high-low price bar on the printed chart and draw a vertical line at that position.

Why 90 degrees and why 180 degrees? The 90 degree angle (and its multiples, 180, 270, 360…) are very important in the stock market, particularly with daily and longer data. You will find that many, many swings and pullbacks are stopped dead on a 90 degree angle from a pivot top or bottom.

As a general rule, when calculating price angles (the horizontal lines) and time spacing for the Square of Nine Roadmap Charts we want to calculate with a number that has three significant digits, or in other words, three digits to the left of the decimal point. Before doing the calculation for the 45 degree angles and for the time spacing on the DJX charts we converted the base price 84.26 to 842.6 before taking the square root. That provided us with a time spacing of 29 bars on the hourly Roadmap chart. The 45 degree angles we calculated for the horizontal price lines were based on a starting price of 842.6 (84.26 x 10) and then converted back to two digits for placement on the chart.

How did we know that the 21st cycle of 180 degrees down from the all time closing high of AOL would be important? We didn't, at least not until July 25, 2002. The Square of Nine on many occasions will show definite predictive qualities, but you usually only learn that after the fact. The success of turning technique into a method you can trust is not simple and it's not easy. We can only propose that success may come to those who seek to harness the power of the Square of Nine not to predict the future but to know when it is here.

The formula for converting a price level or a number of bars or calendar days to degrees of a circle is straightforward and can be done on any calculator with a square root function key or a power function key. The formula for Excel is: MOD((SQRT( (N))*180)-225,360) where N is the price, or price range, or time in days or bars that we want to convert. Punching the formula into a $10 calculator is more labor intensive because of the MOD 360 business. Here's the keystroke sequence for finding the degrees of circle for the number 74. Keystrokes Step 1: SQRT(74) * 180 = 1548.42 Step 2: 1548.42 - 225 = 1323.42 Step 3: 1323.42 / 360 = 3.676 Step 4: 3.676 - 3 = .676 Step 5: .676 * 360 = 243.42

The threshold question is what does the term squaring price and time mean? For all the applications in this book it means that price (or a price range) in degrees equals time units in degrees, or that price is 180 degrees or 90 degrees opposed to time.

There are five primary ways that price squares with time: • Current price squares with time elapsed from a prior change in trend. • Time in a prior trend squares with the price range of the current trend. • Price range in a prior trend squares with time in the current trend. • Price ending prior trend squares with time in the current trend. • Price range in the current trend squares with time in the current trend.

A trend is more elusive to define because a meaningful definition to you depends greatly on the time frame in which you operate and the way you handle risk tolerance and money management. The Roadmap charts may provide a more objective definition. A long term trend ends when price breaks cleanly beyond the upper or lower outer channel boundary, and a short term trend ends when the same thing happens on the hourly Roadmap chart. We use the terms trend and swing interchangeably throughout this book.

The conversion of time to degrees is simple enough from the Static Degrees conversion table. For the price side of things the first to check is the close on March 12. 75.52 = 259 degrees, 349 degrees, 79 degrees, 169 degrees (0, +90, +180, +270). 38 TD = 165 degrees. The close is within 4 degrees of square with the trading day count at a 90 degree offset. Let's also check for squaring with the low price on March 12. 74.17 = 245 degrees, 335 degrees, 65 degrees, 155 degrees (0, +90, +180, +270). 58 CD = 66 degrees. The low is within 1 degree of square with the calendar day count at a 90 degree offset. You could reasonably conclude that the DJX squared price and time on March 12. Please notice that we did not convert the DJX to three digits before doing the calculation because we were working with a base price and not a price range.

There was no three digit conversion so the low price at 1248.55 = 15.26 degrees, 105.26, 195.26, 285.26. (0, +90, +180, +270). 34 TD = 105 degrees.

Chart 8 On a closing price basis, from START to A there was a swing of 22 TD. If you were doing your analysis at the close of trading at Point B you would determine if the market squared price and time that day by measuring the close-to-close price range of the swing from A to B, converting that price range into degrees (185.94 = 70 degrees), converting the 22 TD into degrees (22 = 259 degrees) and seeing if you got a hit. 259 - 70 = 189. Nine degrees separation from a multiple of 90 degrees is too much separation to call it a squaring. Close-to-low numbers work out to a swing of 186.90 points = 76 degrees. 259 - 76 = 183 degrees, which provides an acceptable 3 degrees of separation

Close-to-low numbers work out to a swing of 186.90 points = 76 degrees. 259 - 76 = 183 degrees, which provides an acceptable 3 degrees of separation Note that we're using rounded numbers for most of these examples. You can quickly get the degrees for any number up to 225 from the Static Numbers to Degrees Table. The whole process takes only seconds once the raw data is gathered together. At Point C the price range of the swing on a closing basis is 162.11 points which is a tad more than 266 degrees. The duration of the prior swing was 33 TDs which converts to 89 degrees putting the price range at Point C and the time units of the prior swing within a few degrees of square at an offset of 180 degrees. 266 - 89 = 177. If the multiple of 90 degrees happens to be 180 degrees that's even "better" and if it's 360 degrees that is the "best."

Chart 10 The high to low range of the August 22 - October 10 downswing was 196.37 points in the cash index. Rounding to 196 and reading directly from the Conversion Table we see that 196 points = 135 degrees. From the October 10 low to the high of the next swing was 36 TDs. From the Conversion Table we see that 36 also equals 135 degrees so the SPX has squared price and time at what turned out to be the beginning of a 146 point downswing in the cash index. Here's another example with a $20 stock. DELL made a swing low in September, '02 and a swing high in November, '02 with a closing price range of 6.64 points.

It's easy enough to use the second formula to also do the calculations for the three 90 degree offsets of the primary angle, in effect, squaring the circle.

This technique is best suited for squaring a price range that has occurred after 100 or more bars or calendar days. Generally speaking, the more bars or calendar days between the start date and end date of the range the better. A very nonmathematical explanation can be illustrated with the chart below. The chart graphs the angles for the numerals 1 - 247 as they cycle from 0 to 360 degrees. Chart 13 Although the magnitude and shape of the sawtooth pattern does not change as the number of bars or incidents increases, the slope of the change becomes flatter over time as the number of bars or days increases. In effect the "noise" is reduced as time increases. You could do this squaring calculation on a daily chart for any ticker from the first day after you suspect that the trend has changed. You will score hits from time to time, particularly as the number of trading days or calendar days increases, but we find that the best results on daily charts occur with well defined trends that cover months of trading. This Excel chart of the DJX for the period from March, 2002 to October, 2002 shows the power of this technique. There were 142 trading days from the peak of the Bear Market rally that ended in March, 2002 to the Bear Market Low (to date) that occurred on October 10, 2002. The trading range from peak to valley was 34.76 points which rounds to 35. The degree conversion for 142 trading days gives a result of 120 degrees. A price range of 35 converts to 120 degrees. The DJX squared price and time on October 10, 2002, the day of the Bear Market low to date, with the rally high on March 12. If you do the math to two decimal places from the precise high to the precise low the result will not come out a perfect 120 degrees, but at some undetermined moment within the two daily bars on March 19, 2002 and October 10, 2002 the DJX squared price and time exactly. Using this technique we did not get a squaring with the March 19 high at the time of the previous Bear Market low in July. Was that a tip-off that the lower low was still to come?

We waste our time with short-term thinking and busywork. Warren Buffett spends a year deciding and a day acting. That act lasts decades. Just from being marginally better, like running a quarter mile a fraction of a second faster, some people get paid a lot more—orders of magnitude more. Leverage magnifies those differences even more. Being at the extreme in your art is very important in the age of leverage. [2]

The really smart thinkers are clear thinkers. They understand the basics at a very, very fundamental level. I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can’t stitch together and can’t rederive from the basics. If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing. [4]

To me, happiness is not about positive thoughts. It’s not about negative thoughts. It’s about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. The fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving, because the mind really exists in motion toward the future or the past.

I’ve also come to believe in the complete and utter insignificance of the self, and I think that helps a lot. For example, if you thought you were the most important thing in the Universe, then you would have to bend the entire Universe to your will. If you’re the most important thing in the Universe, then how could it not conform to your desires. If it doesn’t conform to your desires, something is wrong. However, if you view yourself as a bacteria or an amoeba—or if you view all of your works as writing on water or building castles in the sand, then you have no expectation for how life should “actually” be. Life is just the way it is. When you accept that, you have no cause to be happy or unhappy. Those things almost don’t apply.

No, this is the existence little children live. If you look at little children, on balance, they’re generally pretty happy because they are really immersed in the environment and the moment, without any thought of how it should be given their personal preferences and desires. I think the neutral state is actually a perfection state. One can be very happy as long as one isn’t too caught up in their own head.

I love on the back cover how it has this great little pitch that says, “The only book used in both grade school and graduate school.” It’s true. It’s all simple physics puzzles that can be explained to a twelve-year-old child and can be explained to a twenty-five-year-old grad student in physics. They all have fundamental insights in physics. They’re all kind of tricky, but anyone can get to the answer through purely logical reasoning. [4] The Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant This is a great book I really like that summarizes some of the larger themes of history; it’s very incisive. And unlike most history books, it’s actually really small, and it covers a lot of ground. [7] The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg This is the best book I’ve read since Sapiens (far less mainstream, though).

Biologists classify organisms into species. Animals are said to belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each other, giving birth to fertile offspring. Horses and donkeys have a recent common ancestor and share many physical traits. But they show little sexual interest in one another. They will mate if induced to do so – but their offspring, called mules, are sterile. Mutations in donkey DNA can therefore never cross over to horses, or vice versa. The two types of animals are consequently considered two distinct species, moving along separate evolutionary paths. By contrast, a bulldog and a spaniel may look very different, but they are members of the same species, sharing the same DNA pool. They will happily mate and their puppies will grow up to pair off with other dogs and produce more puppies.

The fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. It’s not easy to carry around, especially when encased inside a massive skull. It’s even harder to fuel. In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time energy. Archaic humans paid for their large brains in two ways. Firstly, they spent more time in search of food. Secondly, their muscles atrophied. Like a government diverting money from defence to education, humans diverted energy from biceps to neurons. It’s hardly a foregone conclusion that this is a good strategy for survival on the savannah. A chimpanzee can’t win an argument with a Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll.

Another singular human trait is that we walk upright on two legs. Standing up, it’s easier to scan the savannah for game or enemies, and arms that are unnecessary for locomotion are freed for other purposes, like throwing stones or signalling. The more things these hands could do, the more successful their owners were, so evolutionary pressure brought about an increasing concentration of nerves and finely tuned muscles in the palms and fingers. As a result, humans can perform very intricate tasks with their hands. In particular, they can produce and use sophisticated tools. The first evidence for tool production dates from about 2.5 million years ago, and the manufacture and use of tools are the criteria by which archaeologists recognise ancient humans. Yet walking upright has its downside. The skeleton of our primate ancestors developed for millions of years to support a creature that walked on all fours and had a relatively small head. Adjusting to an upright position was quite a challenge, especially when the scaffolding had to support an extra-large cranium. Humankind paid for its lofty vision and industrious hands with backaches and stiff necks.

An upright gait required narrower hips, constricting the birth canal – and this just when babies’ heads were getting bigger and bigger. Death in childbirth became a major hazard for human females. Women who gave birth earlier, when the infant’s brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children. Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still underdeveloped. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education.

Most top predators of the planet are majestic creatures. Millions of years of dominion have filled them with self-confidence. Sapiens by contrast is more like a banana-republic dictator. Having so recently been one of the underdogs of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. Many historical calamities, from deadly wars to ecological catastrophes, have resulted from this over-hasty jump.

animals, nuts and tubers. But the best thing fire did was cook. Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural forms – such as wheat, rice and potatoes – became staples of our diet thanks to cooking. Fire not only changed food’s chemistry, it changed its biology as well. Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food. Humans also had a far easier time chewing and digesting old favourites such as fruits, nuts, insects and carrion if they were cooked. Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines.

Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens.

According to the Interbreeding Theory, when Sapiens spread into Neanderthal lands, Sapiens bred with Neanderthals until the two populations merged. If this is the case, then today’s Eurasians are not pure Sapiens. They are a mixture of Sapiens and Neanderthals. Similarly, when Sapiens reached East Asia, they interbred with the local Erectus, so the Chinese and Koreans are a mixture of Sapiens and Erectus.

Every two species that evolved from a common ancestor, such as horses and donkeys, were at one time just two populations of the same species, like bulldogs and spaniels. There must have been a point when the two populations were already quite different from one another, but still capable on rare occasions of having sex and producing fertile offspring. Then another mutation severed this last connecting thread, and they went their separate evolutionary ways. It seems that about 50,000 years ago, Sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans were at that borderline point. They were almost, but not quite, entirely separate species.

The most common answer is that our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A green monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they should approach the river, chase away the lion, and hunt the bison.

A platoon of thirty soldiers or even a company of a hundred soldiers can function well on the basis of intimate relations, with a minimum of formal discipline. A well-respected sergeant can become ‘king of the company’ and exercise authority even over commissioned officers. A small family business can survive and flourish without a board of directors, a CEO or an accounting department. But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust. How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.

As a prime example, consider the repeated appearance of childless elites, such as the Catholic priesthood, Buddhist monastic orders and Chinese eunuch bureaucracies. The existence of such elites goes against the most fundamental principles of natural selection, since these dominant members of society willingly give up procreation. Whereas chimpanzee alpha males use their power to have sex with as many females as possible – and consequently sire a large proportion of their troop’s young – the Catholic alpha male abstains completely from sexual intercourse and childcare. This abstinence does not result from unique environmental conditions such as a severe lack of food or want of potential mates. Nor is it the result of some quirky genetic mutation. The Catholic Church has survived for centuries, not by passing on a ‘celibacy gene’ from one pope to the next, but by passing on the stories of the New Testament and of Catholic canon law.

A typical forager 30,000 years ago had access to only one type of sweet food – ripe fruit. If a Stone Age woman came across a tree groaning with figs, the most sensible thing to do was to eat as many of them as she could on the spot, before the local baboon band picked the tree bare. The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes.

All the settlers of Australia had at their disposal was Stone Age technology. How could they cause an ecological disaster? There are three explanations that mesh quite nicely. Large animals – the primary victims of the Australian extinction – breed slowly. Pregnancy is long, offspring per pregnancy are few, and there are long breaks between pregnancies. Consequently, if humans cut down even one diprotodon every few months, it would be enough to cause diprotodon deaths to outnumber births. Within a few thousand years the last lonesome diprotodon would pass away, and with her the entire species.4

Scholars once proclaimed that the agricultural revolution was a great leap forward for humanity. They told a tale of progress fuelled by human brain power. Evolution gradually produced ever more intelligent people. Eventually, people were so smart that they were able to decipher nature’s secrets, enabling them to tame sheep and cultivate wheat. As soon as this happened, they cheerfully abandoned the gruelling, dangerous and often spartan life of hunter-gatherers, settling down to enjoy the pleasant, satiated life of farmers.

The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.2

Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields. This completely changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word ‘domesticate’ comes from the Latin ‘domus’, which means ‘house’. Who’s the one living in a house? Not the wheat. It’s the Sapiens.

Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially. Around 13,000 BC, when people fed themselves by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals, the area around the oasis of Jericho, in Palestine, could support at most one roaming band of about a hundred relatively healthy and well-nourished people. Around 8500 BC, when wild plants gave way to wheat fields, the oasis supported a large but cramped village of 1,000 people, who suffered far more from disease and malnourishment.

Gradually they also started to weed the fields, to guard them against parasites, and to water and fertilise them. As more effort was directed towards cereal cultivation, there was less time to gather and hunt wild species. The foragers became farmers.

With the move to permanent villages and the increase in food supply, the population began to grow. Giving up the nomadic lifestyle enabled women to have a child every year. Babies were weaned at an earlier age – they could be fed on porridge and gruel. The extra hands were sorely needed in the fields. But the extra mouths quickly wiped out the food surpluses, so even more fields had to be planted. As people began living in disease-ridden settlements, as children fed more on cereals and less on mother’s milk, and as each child competed for his or her porridge with more and more siblings, child mortality soared. In most agricultural societies at least one out of every three children died before reaching twenty.5 Yet the increase in births still outpaced the increase in deaths; humans kept having larger numbers of children.

It’s likely that the cultural centre of Göbekli Tepe was somehow connected to the initial domestication of wheat by humankind and of humankind by wheat. In order to feed the people who built and used the monumental structures, particularly large quantities of food were required. It may well be that foragers switched from gathering wild wheat to intense wheat cultivation, not to increase their normal food supply, but rather to support the building and running of a temple. In the conventional picture, pioneers first built a village, and when it prospered, they set up a temple in the middle. But Göbekli Tepe suggests that the temple may have been built first, and that a village later grew up around it.

Alternatively, hunters may have caught and ‘adopted’ a lamb, fattening it during the months of plenty and slaughtering it in the leaner season. At some stage they began keeping a greater number of such lambs. Some of these reached puberty and began to procreate. The most aggressive and unruly lambs were first to the slaughter. The most submissive, most appealing lambs were allowed to live longer and procreate. The result was a herd of domesticated and submissive sheep. Such domesticated animals – sheep, chickens, donkeys and others – supplied food (meat, milk, eggs), raw materials (skins, wool) and muscle power. Transportation, ploughing, grinding and other tasks, hitherto performed by human sinew, were increasingly carried out by animals. In most farming societies people focused on plant cultivation; raising animals was a secondary activity. But a new kind of society also appeared in some places, based primarily on the exploitation of animals: tribes of pastoralist herders.

Similarly, the dollar, human rights and the United States of America exist in the shared imagination of billions, and no single individual can threaten their existence. If I alone were to stop believing in the dollar, in human rights or in the United States, it wouldn’t much matter. These imagined orders are inter-subjective, so in order to change them we must simultaneously change the consciousness of billions of people, which is not easy. A change of such magnitude can be accomplished only with the help of a complex organisation, such as a political party, an ideological movement, or a religious cult. However, in order to establish such complex organisations, it’s necessary to convince many strangers to cooperate with one another. And this will happen only if these strangers believe in some shared myths. It follows that in order to change an existing imagined order, we must first believe in an alternative imagined order.

The large societies found in some other species, such as ants and bees, are stable and resilient because most of the information needed to sustain them is encoded in the genome. A female honeybee larva can, for example, grow up to be either a queen or a worker, depending on what food it is fed. Its DNA programmes the necessary behaviours for whatever role it will fulfil in life. Hives can be very complex social structures, containing many different kinds of workers, such as harvesters, nurses and cleaners. But so far researchers have failed to locate lawyer bees. Bees don’t need lawyers, because there is no danger that they might forget or violate the hive constitution. The queen does not cheat the cleaner bees of their food, and they never go on strike demanding higher wages.

The first to overcome the problem were the ancient Sumerians, who lived in southern Mesopotamia. There, a scorching sun beating upon rich muddy plains produced plentiful harvests and prosperous towns. As the number of inhabitants grew, so did the amount of information required to coordinate their affairs. Between the years 3500 BC and 3000 BC, some unknown Sumerian geniuses invented a system for storing and processing information outside their brains, one that was custom-built to handle large amounts of mathematical data. The Sumerians thereby released their social order from the limitations of the human brain, opening the way for the appearance of cities, kingdoms and empires. The data-processing system invented by the Sumerians is called ‘writing’.

Every decade archaeologists discover another few forgotten scripts. Some of them might prove to be even older than the Sumerian scratches in clay. But most of them remain curiosities because those who invented them failed to invent efficient ways of cataloguing and retrieving data. What set apart Sumer, as well as pharaonic Egypt, ancient China and the Inca Empire, is that these cultures developed good techniques of archiving, cataloguing and retrieving written records.

Hunter-gatherers had no money. Each band hunted, gathered and manufactured almost everything it required, from meat to medicine, from sandals to sorcery. Different band members may have specialised in different tasks, but they shared their goods and services through an economy of favours and obligations. A piece of meat given for free would carry with it the assumption of reciprocity – say, free medical assistance. The band was economically independent; only a few rare items that could not be found locally – seashells, pigments, obsidian and the like – had to be obtained from strangers. This could usually be done by simple barter: ‘We’ll give you pretty seashells, and you’ll give us high-quality flint.’

An economy of favours and obligations doesn’t work when large numbers of strangers try to cooperate. It’s one thing to provide free assistance to a sister or a neighbour, a very different thing to take care of foreigners who might never reciprocate the favour. One can fall back on barter. But barter is effective only when exchanging a limited range of products. It cannot form the basis for a complex economy.

Initially, when the first versions of money were created, people didn’t have this sort of trust, so it was necessary to define as ‘money’ things that had real intrinsic value. History’s first known money – Sumerian barley money – is a good example. It appeared in Sumer around 3000 BC, at the same time and place, and under the same circumstances, in which writing appeared. Just as writing developed to answer the needs of intensifying administrative activities, so barley money developed to answer the needs of intensifying economic activities. Barley money was simply barley – fixed amounts of barley grains used as a universal measure for evaluating and exchanging all other goods and services. The most common measurement was the sila, equivalent to roughly one litre. Standardised bowls, each capable of containing one sila, were mass-produced so that whenever people needed to buy or sell anything, it was easy to measure the necessary amounts of barley. Salaries, too, were set and paid in silas of barley. A male labourer earned sixty silas a month, a female labourer thirty silas. A foreman could earn between 1,200 and 5,000 silas. Not even the most ravenous foreman could eat 5,000 litres of barley a month, but he could use the silas he didn’t eat to buy all sorts of other commodities – oil, goats, slaves, and something else to eat besides barley.

Coins had two important advantages over unmarked metal ingots. First, the latter had to be weighed for every transaction. Second, weighing the ingot is not enough. How does the shoemaker know that the silver ingot I put down for my boots is really made of pure silver, and not of lead covered on the outside by a thin silver coating? Coins help solve these problems. The mark imprinted on them testifies to their exact value, so the shoemaker doesn’t have to keep a scale on his cash register. More importantly, the mark on the coin is the signature of some political authority that guarantees the coin’s value.

The trust in Rome’s coins was so strong that even outside the empire’s borders, people were happy to receive payment in denarii. In the first century AD, Roman coins were an accepted medium of exchange in the markets of India, even though the closest Roman legion was thousands of kilometres away. The Indians had such a strong confidence in the denarius and the image of the emperor that when local rulers struck coins of their own they closely imitated the denarius, down to the portrait of the Roman emperor! The name ‘denarius’ became a generic name for coins. Muslim caliphs Arabicised this name and issued ‘dinars’. The dinar is still the official name of the currency in Jordan, Iraq, Serbia, Macedonia, Tunisia and several other countries.

Assume that when regular trade opened between India and the Mediterranean, Indians were uninterested in gold, so it was almost worthless. But in the Mediterranean, gold was a coveted status symbol, hence its value was high. What would happen next? Merchants travelling between India and the Mediterranean would notice the difference in the value of gold. In order to make a profit, they would buy gold cheaply in India and sell it dearly in the Mediterranean. Consequently, the demand for gold in India would skyrocket, as would its value. At the same time the Mediterranean would experience an influx of gold, whose value would consequently drop. Within a short time the value of gold in India and the Mediterranean would be quite similar. The mere fact that Mediterranean people believed in gold would cause Indians to start believing in it as well.

An empire is a political order with two important characteristics. First, to qualify for that designation you have to rule over a significant number of distinct peoples, each possessing a different cultural identity and a separate territory. How many peoples exactly? Two or three is not sufficient. Twenty or thirty is plenty. The imperial threshold passes somewhere in between. Second, empires are characterised by flexible borders and a potentially unlimited appetite. They can swallow and digest more and more nations and territories without altering their basic structure or identity. The British state of today has fairly clear borders that cannot be exceeded without altering the fundamental structure and identity of the state. A century ago almost any place on earth could have become part of the British Empire.

The first empire about which we have definitive information was the Akkadian Empire of Sargon the Great (c.2250 BC). Sargon began his career as the king of Kish, a small city state in Mesopotamia. Within a few decades he managed to conquer not only all other Mesopotamian city states, but also large territories outside the Mesopotamian heartland. Sargon boasted that he had conquered the entire world. In reality, his dominion stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, and included most of today’s Iraq and Syria, along with a few slices of modern Iran and Turkey.

The big breakthrough came with Christianity. This faith began as an esoteric Jewish sect that sought to convince Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their long-awaited messiah. However, one of the sect’s first leaders, Paul of Tarsus, reasoned that if the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, and if He had bothered to incarnate Himself in the flesh and to die on the cross for the salvation of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about, not just Jews. It was thus necessary to spread the good word – the gospel – about Jesus throughout the world. Paul’s arguments fell on fertile ground. Christians began organising widespread missionary activities aimed at all humans. In one of history’s strangest twists, this esoteric Jewish sect took over the mighty Roman Empire. Christian success served as a model for another monotheist religion that appeared in the Arabian peninsula in the seventh century – Islam. Like Christianity, Islam, too, began as a small sect in a remote corner of the world, but in an even stranger and swifter historical surprise it managed to break out of the deserts of Arabia and conquer an immense empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to India. Henceforth, the monotheist idea played a central role in world history. Monotheists have tended to be far more fanatical and missionary than polytheists. A religion that recognises the legitimacy of other faiths implies either that its god is not the supreme power of the universe, or that it received from God just part of the universal truth. Since monotheists have usually believed that they are in possession of the entire message of the one and only God, they have been compelled to discredit all other religions. Over the last two millennia, monotheists repeatedly tried to strengthen their hand by violently exterminating all competition. It worked. At the beginning of the first century AD, there were hardly any monotheists in the world. Around AD 500, one of the world’s largest empires – the Roman Empire – was a Christian polity, and missionaries were busy spreading Christianity to other parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. By the end of the first millennium AD, most people in Europe, West Asia and North Africa were monotheists, and empires from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalayas claimed to be ordained by the single great God. By the early sixteenth century, monotheism dominated most of Afro-Asia, with the exception of East Asia and the southern parts of Africa, and it began extending long tentacles towards South Africa, America and Oceania. Today most people outside East Asia adhere to one monotheist religion or another, and the global political order is built on monotheistic foundations.

The city of Milan had St Ambrose, while St Mark watched over Venice. St Florian protected chimney cleaners, whereas St Matthew lent a hand to tax collectors in distress. If you suffered from headaches you had to pray to St Agathius, but if from toothaches then St Apollonia was a much better audience. The Christian saints did not merely resemble the old polytheistic gods. Often they were these very same gods in disguise. For example, the chief goddess of Celtic Ireland prior to the coming of Christianity was Brigid. When Ireland was Christianised, Brigid too was baptised. She became St Brigit, who to this day is the most revered saint in Catholic Ireland.

Gautama grounded these meditation techniques in a set of ethical rules meant to make it easier for people to focus on actual experience and to avoid falling into cravings and fantasies. He instructed his followers to avoid killing, promiscuous sex and theft, since such acts necessarily stoke the fire of craving (for power, for sensual pleasure or for wealth). When the flames are completely extinguished, craving is replaced by a state of perfect contentment and serenity, known as nirvana (the literal meaning of which is ‘extinguishing the fire’). Those who have attained nirvana are fully liberated from all suffering. They experience reality with the utmost clarity, free of fantasies and delusions. While they will most likely still encounter unpleasantness and pain, such experiences cause them no misery. A person who does not crave cannot suffer.

Until the Scientific Revolution most human cultures did not believe in progress. They thought the golden age was in the past, and that the world was stagnant, if not deteriorating. Strict adherence to the wisdom of the ages might perhaps bring back the good old times, and human ingenuity might conceivably improve this or that facet of daily life. However, it was considered impossible for human know-how to overcome the world’s fundamental problems. If even Muhammad, Jesus, Buddha and Confucius – who knew everything there is to know – were unable to abolish famine, disease, poverty and war from the world, how could we expect to do so? Many faiths believed that some day a messiah would appear and end all wars, famines and even death itself. But the notion that humankind could do so by discovering new knowledge and inventing new tools was worse than ludicrous – it was hubris. The story of the Tower of Babel, the story of Icarus, the story of the Golem and countless other myths taught people that any attempt to go beyond human limitations would inevitably lead to disappointment and disaster. When modern culture admitted that there were many important things that it still did not know, and when that admission of ignorance was married to the idea that scientific discoveries could give us new powers, people began suspecting that real progress might be possible after all. As science began to solve one unsolvable problem after another, many became convinced that humankind could overcome any and every problem by acquiring and applying new knowledge. Poverty, sickness, wars, famines, old age and death itself were not the inevitable fate of humankind. They were simply the fruits of our ignorance.

How did the people of this frigid finger of Eurasia manage to break out of their remote corner of the globe and conquer the entire world? Europe’s scientists are often given much of the credit. It’s unquestionable that from 1850 onward European domination rested to a large extent on the military–industrial–scientific complex and technological wizardry. All successful late modern empires cultivated scientific research in the hope of harvesting technological innovations, and many scientists spent most of their time working on arms, medicines and machines for their imperial masters. A common saying among European soldiers facing African enemies was ‘Come what may, we have machine guns, and they don’t.’ Civilian technologies were no less important. Canned food fed soldiers, railroads and steamships transported soldiers and their provisions, while a new arsenal of medicines cured soldiers, sailors and locomotive engineers. These logistical advances played a more significant role in the European conquest of Africa than did the machine gun. But that wasn’t the case before 1850. The military–industrial–scientific complex was still in its infancy; the technological fruits of the Scientific Revolution were unripe; and the technological gap between European, Asiatic and African powers was small. In 1770, James Cook certainly had far better technology than the Australian Aborigines, but so did the Chinese and the Ottomans. Why then was Australia explored and colonised by Captain James Cook and not by Captain Wan Zhengse or Captain Hussein Pasha? More importantly, if in 1770 Europeans had no significant technological advantage over Muslims, Indians and Chinese, how did they manage in the following century to open such a gap between themselves and the rest of the world? Why did the military–industrial–scientific complex blossom in Europe rather than India? When Britain leaped forward, why were France, Germany and the United States quick to follow, whereas China lagged behind? When the gap between industrial and non-industrial nations became an obvious economic and political factor, why did Russia, Italy and Austria succeed in closing it, whereas Persia, Egypt and the Ottoman Empire failed? After all, the technology of the first industrial wave was relatively simple. Was it so hard for Chinese or Ottomans to engineer steam engines, manufacture machine guns and lay down railroads? The world’s first commercial railroad opened for business in 1830, in Britain. By 1850, Western nations were criss-crossed by almost 40,000 kilometres of railroads – but in the whole of Asia, Africa and Latin America there were only 4,000 kilometres of tracks. In 1880, the West boasted more than 350,000 kilometres of railroads, whereas in the rest of the world there were but 35,000 kilometres of train lines (and most of these were laid by the British in India).5 The first railroad in China opened only in 1876. It was twenty-five kilometres long and built by Europeans – the Chinese government destroyed it the following year. In 1880 the Chinese Empire did not operate a single railroad. The first railroad in Persia was built only in 1888, and it connected Tehran with a Muslim holy site about ten kilometres south of the capital. It was constructed and operated by a Belgian company. In 1950, the total railway network of Persia still amounted to a meagre 2,500 kilometres, in a country seven times the size of Britain.6 The Chinese and Persians did not lack technological inventions such as steam engines (which could be freely copied or bought). They lacked the values, myths, judicial apparatus and sociopolitical structures that took centuries to form and mature in the West and which could not be copied and internalised rapidly. France and the United States quickly followed in Britain’s footsteps because the French and Americans already shared the most important British myths and social structures. The Chinese and Persians could not catch up as quickly because they thought and organised their societies differently. This explanation sheds new light on the period from 1500 to 1850. During this era Europe did not enjoy any obvious technological, political, military or economic advantage over the Asian powers, yet the continent built up a unique potential, whose importance suddenly became obvious around 1850. The apparent equality between Europe, China and the Muslim world in 1750 was a mirage. Imagine two builders, each busy constructing very tall towers. One builder uses wood and mud bricks, whereas the other uses steel and concrete. At first it seems that there is not much of a difference between the two methods, since both towers grow at a similar pace and reach a similar height. However, once a critical threshold is crossed, the wood and mud tower cannot stand the strain and collapses, whereas the steel and concrete tower grows storey by storey, as far as the eye can see. What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to dominate the late modern world? There are two complementary answers to this question: modern science and capitalism. Europeans were used to thinking and behaving in a scientific and capitalist way even before they enjoyed any significant technological advantages. When the technological bonanza began, Europeans could harness it far better than anybody else. So it is hardly coincidental that science and capitalism form the most important legacy that European imperialism has bequeathed the post-European world of the twenty-first century. Europe and Europeans no longer rule the world, but science and capital are growing ever stronger. The victories of capitalism are examined in the following chapter. This chapter is dedicated to the love story between European imperialism and modern science.

What forged the historical bond between modern science and European imperialism? Technology was an important factor in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but in the early modern era it was of limited importance. The key factor was that the plant-seeking botanist and the colony-seeking naval officer shared a similar mindset. Both scientist and conqueror began by admitting ignorance – they both said, ‘I don’t know what’s out there.’ They both felt compelled to go out and make new discoveries. And they both hoped the new knowledge thus acquired would make them masters of the world. European imperialism was entirely unlike all other imperial projects in history. Previous seekers of empire tended to assume that they already understood the world. Conquest merely utilised and spread their view of the world. The Arabs, to name one example, did not conquer Egypt, Spain or India in order to discover something they did not know. The Romans, Mongols and Aztecs voraciously conquered new lands in search of power and wealth – not of knowledge. In contrast, European imperialists set out to distant shores in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories.

These European explore-and-conquer expeditions are so familiar to us that we tend to overlook just how extraordinary they were. Nothing like them had ever happened before. Long-distance campaigns of conquest are not a natural undertaking. Throughout history most human societies were so busy with local conflicts and neighbourhood quarrels that they never considered exploring and conquering distant lands. Most great empires extended their control only over their immediate neighbourhood – they reached far-flung lands simply because their neighbourhood kept expanding. Thus the Romans conquered Etruria in order to defend Rome (c.350–300 BC). They then conquered the Po Valley in order to defend Etruria (c.200 BC). They subsequently conquered Provence to defend the Po Valley (c.120 BC), Gaul to defend Provence (c.50 BC), and Britain in order to defend Gaul (c. AD 50). It took them 400 years to get from Rome to London. In 350 BC, no Roman would have conceived of sailing directly to Britain and conquering it.

For 300 years, Europeans enjoyed undisputed mastery in America and Oceania, in the Atlantic and the Pacific. The only significant struggles in those regions were between different European powers. The wealth and resources accumulated by the Europeans eventually enabled them to invade Asia too, defeat its empires, and divide it among themselves. When the Ottomans, Persians, Indians and Chinese woke up and began paying attention, it was too late.

Modern science and modern empires were motivated by the restless feeling that perhaps something important awaited beyond the horizon – something they had better explore and master. Yet the connection between science and empire went much deeper. Not just the motivation, but also the practices of empire-builders were entangled with those of scientists. For modern Europeans, building an empire was a scientific project, while setting up a scientific discipline was an imperial project.

When the Muslims conquered India, they did not bring along archaeologists to systematically study Indian history, anthropologists to study Indian cultures, geologists to study Indian soils, or zoologists to study Indian fauna. When the British conquered India, they did all of these things. On 10 April 1802 the Great Survey of India was launched. It lasted sixty years. With the help of tens of thousands of native labourers, scholars and guides, the British carefully mapped the whole of India, marking borders, measuring distances, and even calculating for the first time the exact height of Mount Everest and the other Himalayan peaks. The British explored the military resources of Indian provinces and the location of their gold mines, but they also took the trouble to collect information about rare Indian spiders, to catalogue colourful butterflies, to trace the ancient origins of extinct Indian languages, and to dig up forgotten ruins. Mohenjo-daro was one of the chief cities of the Indus Valley civilisation, which flourished in the third millennium BC and was destroyed around 1900 BC. None of India’s pre-British rulers – neither the Mauryas, nor the Guptas, nor the Delhi sultans, nor the great Mughals – had given the ruins a second glance. But a British archaeological survey took notice of the site in 1922. A British team then excavated it, and discovered the first great civilisation of India, which no Indian had been aware of.

Their superior knowledge had obvious practical advantages. Without such knowledge, it is unlikely that a ridiculously small number of Britons could have succeeded in governing, oppressing and exploiting so many hundreds of millions of Indians for two centuries. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fewer than 5,000 British officials, about 40,000–70,000 British soldiers, and perhaps another 100,000 British business people, hangers-on, wives and children were sufficient to conquer and rule up to 300 million Indians.

In truth, neither the narrative of oppression and exploitation nor that of ‘the White Man’s burden’ completely matches the facts. The European empires did so many different things on such a large scale, that you can find plenty of examples to support whatever you want to say about them. You think that these empires were evil monstrosities that spread death, oppression and injustice around the world? You could easily fill an encyclopedia with their crimes. You want to argue that they in fact improved the conditions of their subjects with new medicines, better economic conditions and greater security? You could fill another encyclopedia with their achievements. Due to their close cooperation with science, these empires wielded so much power and changed the world to such an extent that perhaps they cannot be simply labelled as good or evil. They created the world as we know it, including the ideologies we use in order to judge them.

They noticed that the earliest Sanskrit speakers, who had invaded India from Central Asia more than 3,000 years ago, had called themselves Arya. The speakers of the earliest Persian language called themselves Airiia. European scholars consequently surmised that the people who spoke the primordial language that gave birth to both Sanskrit and Persian (as well as to Greek, Latin, Gothic and Celtic) must have called themselves Aryans. Could it be a coincidence that those who founded the magnificent Indian, Persian, Greek and Roman civilisations were all Aryans?

Next, British, French and German scholars wedded the linguistic theory about the industrious Aryans to Darwin’s theory of natural selection and posited that the Aryans were not just a linguistic group but a biological entity – a race. And not just any race, but a master race of tall, light-haired, blue-eyed, hard-working, and super-rational humans who emerged from the mists of the north to lay the foundations of culture throughout the world. Regrettably, the Aryans who invaded India and Persia intermarried with the local natives they found in these lands, losing their light complexions and blond hair, and with them their rationality and diligence. The civilisations of India and Persia consequently declined. In Europe, on the other hand, the Aryans preserved their racial purity. This is why Europeans had managed to conquer the world, and why they were fit to rule it – provided they took precautions not to mix with inferior races.

For most of history the economy stayed much the same size. Yes, global production increased, but this was due mostly to demographic expansion and the settlement of new lands. Per capita production remained static. But all that changed in the modern age. In 1500, global production of goods and services was equal to about $250 billion; today it hovers around $60 trillion. More importantly, in 1500, annual per capita production averaged $550, while today every man, woman and child produces, on average, $8,800 a year.1 What accounts for this stupendous growth?

If credit is such a wonderful thing, why did nobody think of it earlier? Of course they did. Credit arrangements of one kind or another have existed in all known human cultures, going back at least to ancient Sumer. The problem in previous eras was not that no one had the idea or knew how to use it. It was that people seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn’t trust that the future would be better than the present. They generally believed that times past had been better than their own times and that the future would be worse, or at best much the same. To put that in economic terms, they believed that the total amount of wealth was limited, if not dwindling. People therefore considered it a bad bet to assume that they personally, or their kingdom, or the entire world, would be producing more wealth ten years down the line. Business looked like a zero-sum game. Of course, the profits of one particular bakery might rise, but only at the expense of the bakery next door. Venice might flourish, but only by impoverishing Genoa. The king of England might enrich himself, but only by robbing the king of France. You could cut the pie in many different ways, but it never got any bigger.

Then came the Scientific Revolution and the idea of progress. The idea of progress is built on the notion that if we admit our ignorance and invest resources in research, things can improve. This idea was soon translated into economic terms. Whoever believes in progress believes that geographical discoveries, technological inventions and organisational developments can increase the sum total of human production, trade and wealth. New trade routes in the Atlantic could flourish without ruining old routes in the Indian Ocean. New goods could be produced without reducing the production of old ones. For instance, one could open a new bakery specialising in chocolate cakes and croissants without causing bakeries specialising in bread to go bust. Everybody would simply develop new tastes and eat more. I can be wealthy without your becoming poor; I can be obese without your dying of hunger. The entire global pie can grow.

Over the last 500 years the idea of progress convinced people to put more and more trust in the future. This trust created credit; credit brought real economic growth; and growth strengthened the trust in the future and opened the way for even more credit. It didn’t happen overnight – the economy behaved more like a roller coaster than a balloon. But over the long run, with the bumps evened out, the general direction was unmistakable. Today, there is so much credit in the world that governments, business corporations and private individuals easily obtain large, long-term and low-interest loans that far exceed current income.

The belief in the growing global pie eventually turned revolutionary. In 1776 the Scottish economist Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, probably the most important economics manifesto of all time. In the eighth chapter of its first volume, Smith made the following novel argument: when a landlord, a weaver or a shoemaker has greater profits than he needs to maintain his own family, he uses the surplus to employ more assistants, in order to further increase his profits. The more profits he has, the more assistants he can employ. It follows that an increase in the profits of private entrepreneurs is the basis for the increase in collective wealth and prosperity. This may not strike you as very original, because we all live in a capitalist world that takes Smith’s argument for granted. We hear variations on this theme every day in the news. Yet Smith’s claim that the selfish human urge to increase private profits is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history – revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but even more so from a moral and political perspective. What Smith says is, in fact, that greed is good, and that by becoming richer I benefit everybody, not just myself. Egoism is altruism.

That’s why capitalism is called ‘capitalism’. Capitalism distinguishes ‘capital’ from mere ‘wealth’. Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried in the ground or wasted on unproductive activities. A pharaoh who pours resources into a non-productive pyramid is not a capitalist. A pirate who loots a Spanish treasure fleet and buries a chest full of glittering coins on the beach of some Caribbean island is not a capitalist. But a hard-working factory hand who reinvests part of his income in the stock market is.

Medieval noblemen wore colourful robes of gold and silk, and devoted much of their time to attending banquets, carnivals and glamorous tournaments. In comparison, modern CEOs don dreary uniforms called suits that afford them all the panache of a flock of crows, and they have little time for festivities. The typical venture capitalist rushes from one business meeting to another, trying to figure out where to invest his capital and following the ups and downs of the stocks and bonds he owns. True, his suits might be Versace and he might get to travel in a private jet, but these expenses are nothing compared to what he invests in increasing human production.

Many expeditions returned to Europe empty-handed, having discovered nothing of value. The English, for instance, wasted a lot of capital in fruitless attempts to discover a north-western passage to Asia through the Arctic. Many other expeditions didn’t return at all. Ships hit icebergs, foundered in tropical storms, or fell victim to pirates. In order to increase the number of potential investors and reduce the risk they incurred, Europeans turned to limited liability joint-stock companies. Instead of a single investor betting all his money on a single rickety ship, the joint-stock company collected money from a large number of investors, each risking only a small portion of his capital. The risks were thereby curtailed, but no cap was placed on the profits. Even a small investment in the right ship could turn you into a millionaire. Decade by decade, western Europe witnessed the development of a sophisticated financial system that could raise large amounts of credit on short notice and put it at the disposal of private entrepreneurs and governments. This system could finance explorations and conquests far more efficiently than any kingdom or empire. The new-found power of credit can be seen in the bitter struggle between Spain and the Netherlands. In the sixteenth century, Spain was the most powerful state in Europe, holding sway over a vast global empire.

The most notorious example of how governments did the bidding of big money was the First Opium War, fought between Britain and China (1840–42). In the first half of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company and sundry British business people made fortunes by exporting drugs, particularly opium, to China. Millions of Chinese became addicts, debilitating the country both economically and socially. In the late 1830s the Chinese government issued a ban on drug trafficking, but British drug merchants simply ignored the law. Chinese authorities began to confiscate and destroy drug cargos. The drug cartels had close connections in Westminster and Downing Street – many MPs and Cabinet ministers in fact held stock in the drug companies – so they pressured the government to take action. In 1840 Britain duly declared war on China in the name of ‘free trade’. It was a walkover. The overconfident Chinese were no match for Britain’s new wonder weapons – steamboats, heavy artillery, rockets and rapid-fire rifles. Under the subsequent peace treaty, China agreed not to constrain the activities of British drug merchants and to compensate them for damages inflicted by the Chinese police. Furthermore, the British demanded and received control of Hong Kong, which they proceeded to use as a secure base for drug trafficking (Hong Kong remained in British hands until 1997). In the late nineteenth century, about 40 million Chinese, a tenth of the country’s population, were opium addicts.

In fact, war itself could become a commodity, just like opium. In 1821 the Greeks rebelled against the Ottoman Empire. The uprising aroused great sympathy in liberal and Romantic circles in Britain – Lord Byron, the poet, even went to Greece to fight alongside the insurgents. But London financiers saw an opportunity as well. They proposed to the rebel leaders the issue of tradable Greek Rebellion Bonds on the London stock exchange. The Greeks would promise to repay the bonds, plus interest, if and when they won their independence. Private investors bought bonds to make a profit, or out of sympathy for the Greek cause, or both. The value of Greek Rebellion Bonds rose and fell on the London stock exchange in tempo with military successes and failures on the battlefields of Hellas.

The Turks gradually gained the upper hand. With a rebel defeat imminent, the bondholders faced the prospect of losing their trousers. The bondholders’ interest was the national interest, so the British organised an international fleet that, in 1827, sank the main Ottoman flotilla in the Battle of Navarino. After centuries of subjugation, Greece was finally free. But freedom came with a huge debt that the new country had no way of repaying. The Greek economy was mortgaged to British creditors for decades to come.

This is why today a country’s credit rating is far more important to its economic well-being than are its natural resources. Credit ratings indicate the probability that a country will pay its debts. In addition to purely economic data, they take into account political, social and even cultural factors. An oil-rich country cursed with a despotic government, endemic warfare and a corrupt judicial system will usually receive a low credit rating. As a result, it is likely to remain relatively poor since it will not be able to raise the necessary capital to make the most of its oil bounty. A country devoid of natural resources, but which enjoys peace, a fair judicial system and a free government is likely to receive a high credit rating. As such, it may be able to raise enough cheap capital to support a good education system and foster a flourishing high-tech industry.

Yet what happens if the greedy shoemaker increases his profits by paying employees less and increasing their work hours? The standard answer is that the free market would protect the employees. If our shoemaker pays too little and demands too much, the best employees would naturally abandon him and go to work for his competitors. The tyrant shoemaker would find himself left with the worst labourers, or with no labourers at all. He would have to mend his ways or go out of business. His own greed would compel him to treat his employees well. This sounds bulletproof in theory, but in practice the bullets get through all too easily. In a completely free market, unsupervised by kings and priests, avaricious capitalists can establish monopolies or collude against their workforces. If there is a single corporation controlling all shoe factories in a country, or if all factory owners conspire to reduce wages simultaneously, then the labourers are no longer able to protect themselves by switching jobs.

The annual sugar intake of the average Englishman rose from near zero in the early seventeenth century to around eight kilograms in the early nineteenth century. However, growing cane and extracting its sugar was a labour-intensive business. Few people wanted to work long hours in malaria-infested sugar fields under a tropical sun. Contract labourers would have produced a commodity too expensive for mass consumption. Sensitive to market forces, and greedy for profits and economic growth, European plantation owners switched to slaves. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, about 10 million African slaves were imported to America. About 70 per cent of them worked on the sugar plantations. Labour conditions were abominable. Most slaves lived a short and miserable life, and millions more died during wars waged to capture slaves or during the long voyage from inner Africa to the shores of America. All this so that Europeans could enjoy their sweet tea and candy – and sugar barons could enjoy huge profits.

Private slave-trading companies sold shares on the Amsterdam, London and Paris stock exchanges. Middle-class Europeans looking for a good investment bought these shares. Relying on this money, the companies bought ships, hired sailors and soldiers, purchased slaves in Africa, and transported them to America. There they sold the slaves to the plantation owners, using the proceeds to purchase plantation products such as sugar, cocoa, coffee, tobacco, cotton and rum. They returned to Europe, sold the sugar and cotton for a good price, and then sailed to Africa to begin another round. The shareholders were very pleased with this arrangement. Throughout the eighteenth century the yield on slave-trade investments was about 6 per cent a year – they were extremely profitable, as any modern consultant would be quick to admit.

In recent decades, and especially after 1945, capitalist greed was somewhat reined in, not least due to the fear of Communism. Yet inequities are still rampant. The economic pie of 2014 is far larger than the pie of 1500, but it is distributed so unevenly that many African peasants and Indonesian labourers return home after a hard day’s work with less food than did their ancestors 500 years ago. Much like the Agricultural Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to be a colossal fraud. The human species and the global economy may well keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want.

Since human and animal bodies were the only energy conversion device available, muscle power was the key to almost all human activities. Human muscles built carts and houses, ox muscles ploughed fields, and horse muscles transported goods. The energy that fuelled these organic muscle-machines came ultimately from a single source – plants. Plants in their turn obtained their energy from the sun. By the process of photosynthesis, they captured solar energy and packed it into organic compounds. Almost everything people did throughout history was fuelled by solar energy that was captured by plants and converted into muscle power.

Throughout these long millennia, day in and day out, people stood face to face with the most important invention in the history of energy production – and failed to notice it. It stared them in the eye every time a housewife or servant put up a kettle to boil water for tea or put a pot full of potatoes on the stove. The minute the water boiled, the lid of the kettle or the pot jumped. Heat was being converted to movement. But jumping pot lids were an annoyance, especially if you forgot the pot on the stove and the water boiled over. Nobody saw their real potential. A partial breakthrough in converting heat into movement followed the invention of gunpowder in ninth-century China. At first, the idea of using gunpowder to propel projectiles was so counter-intuitive that for centuries gunpowder was used primarily to produce fire bombs. But eventually – perhaps after some bomb expert ground gunpowder in a mortar only to have the pestle shoot out with force – guns made their appearance. About 600 years passed between the invention of gunpowder and the development of effective artillery.

There are many types of steam engines, but they all share one common principle. You burn some kind of fuel, such as coal, and use the resulting heat to boil water, producing steam. As the steam expands it pushes a piston. The piston moves, and anything that is connected to the piston moves with it. You have converted heat into movement! In eighteenth-century British coal mines, the piston was connected to a pump that extracted water from the bottom of the mineshafts. The earliest engines were incredibly inefficient. You needed to burn a huge load of coal in order to pump out even a tiny amount of water. But in the mines coal was plentiful and close at hand, so nobody cared.

In the decades that followed, British entrepreneurs improved the efficiency of the steam engine, brought it out of the mineshafts, and connected it to looms and gins. This revolutionised textile production, making it possible to produce ever-larger quantities of cheap textiles. In the blink of an eye, Britain became the workshop of the world. But even more importantly, getting the steam engine out of the mines broke an important psychological barrier. If you could burn coal in order to move textile looms, why not use the same method to move other things, such as vehicles? In 1825, a British engineer connected a steam engine to a train of mine wagons full of coal. The engine drew the wagons along an iron rail some twenty kilometres long from the mine to the nearest harbour. This was the first steam-powered locomotive in history. Clearly, if steam could be used to transport coal, why not other goods?

Henceforth, people became obsessed with the idea that machines and engines could be used to convert one type of energy into another. Any type of energy, anywhere in the world, might be harnessed to whatever need we had, if we could just invent the right machine. For example, when physicists realised that an immense amount of energy is stored within atoms, they immediately started thinking about how this energy could be released and used to make electricity, power submarines and annihilate cities. Six hundred years passed between the moment Chinese alchemists discovered gunpowder and the moment Turkish cannon pulverised the walls of Constantinople. Only forty years passed between the moment Einstein determined that any kind of mass could be converted into energy – that’s what E = mc² means – and the moment atom bombs obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki and nuclear power stations mushroomed all over the globe.

As kingdoms and empires became stronger, they reined in communities and the level of violence decreased. In the decentralised kingdoms of medieval Europe, about twenty to forty people were murdered each year for every 100,000 inhabitants. In recent decades, when states and markets have become all-powerful and communities have vanished, violence rates have dropped even further. Today the global average is only nine murders a year per 100,000 people, and most of these murders take place in weak states such as Somalia and Colombia. In the centralised states of Europe, the average is one murder a year per 100,000 people.7

Though in some places such as Malaya and Kenya the British tried to hang on by force of arms, in most places they accepted the end of empire with a sigh rather than with a temper tantrum. They focused their efforts not on retaining power, but on transferring it as smoothly as possible.

Loyalty to country and comrades comes before even your own life.” The conflict between the old reptilian and the new mammalian brain furnishes the answer to such riddles as “Why does pain have to be so damn painful?” What, after all, is pain for? Pain is a proxy for death. It is a warning to the brain, “Don’t do that again: don’t tease a snake, pick up a hot ember, jump from a great height. This time it only hurt; next time it might kill you.” But now a designing engineer might say what we need here is the equivalent of a painless flag in the brain. When the flag shoots up, don’t repeat whatever you just did. But instead of the engineer’s easy and painless flag, what we actually get is pain—often excruciating, unbearable pain. Why? What’s wrong with the sensible flag? The answer probably lies in the disputatious nature of the brain’s decision-making processes: the tussle between old brain and new brain. It being too easy for the new brain to overrule the vote of the old brain, the painless flag system wouldn’t work. Neither would torture.

Unlike species which often disappear as new ones appear, the brain evolved by adding new parts on top of the older parts. For example, some of the oldest and simplest nervous systems are sets of neurons that run down the back of tiny worms. These neurons allow the worm to make simple movements, and they are the predecessor of our spinal cord, which is similarly responsible for many of our basic movements. Next to appear was a lump of neurons at one end of the body that controlled functions such as digestion and breathing. This lump is the predecessor of our brain stem, which similarly controls our digestion and breathing. The brain stem extended what was already there, but it did not replace it. Over time, the brain grew capable of increasingly complex behaviors by evolving new parts on top of the older parts. This method of growth by addition applies to the brains of most complex animals. It is easy to see why the old brain parts are still there. No matter how smart and sophisticated we are, breathing, eating, sex, and reflex reactions are still critical to our survival.

The newest part of our brain is the neocortex, which means “new outer layer.” All mammals, and only mammals, have a neocortex. The human neocortex is particularly large, occupying about 70 percent of the volume of our brain. If you could remove the neocortex from your head and iron it flat, it would be about the size of a large dinner napkin and twice as thick (about 2.5 millimeters). It wraps around the older parts of the brain such that when you look at a human brain, most of what you see is the neocortex (with its characteristic folds and creases), with bits of the old brain and the spinal cord sticking out the bottom.

The neocortex is the organ of intelligence. Almost all the capabilities we think of as intelligence—such as vision, language, music, math, science, and engineering—are created by the neocortex. When we think about something, it is mostly the neocortex doing the thinking. Your neocortex is reading or listening to this book, and my neocortex is writing this book. If we want to understand intelligence, then we have to understand what the neocortex does and how it does it.

The neocortex and the older parts of the brain are connected via nerve fibers; therefore, we cannot think of them as completely separate organs. They are more like roommates, with separate agendas and personalities, but who need to cooperate to get anything done. The neocortex is in a decidedly unfair position, as it doesn’t control behavior directly. Unlike other parts of the brain, none of the cells in the neocortex connect directly to muscles, so it can’t, on its own, make any muscles move. When the neocortex wants to do something, it sends a signal to the old brain, in a sense asking the old brain to do its bidding. For example, breathing is a function of the brain stem, requiring no thought or input from the neocortex. The neocortex can temporarily control breathing, as when you consciously decide to hold your breath. But if the brain stem detects that your body needs more oxygen, it will ignore the neocortex and take back control. Similarly, the neocortex might think, “Don’t eat this piece of cake. It isn’t healthy.” But if older and more primitive parts of the brain say, “Looks good, smells good, eat it,” the cake can be hard to resist. This battle between the old and new brain is an underlying theme of this book. It will play an important role when we discuss the existential risks facing humanity.

Nonetheless, the neocortex is still divided into several dozen areas, or regions, that perform different functions. Some of the regions are responsible for vision, some for hearing, and some for touch. There are regions responsible for language and planning. When the neocortex is damaged, the deficits that arise depend on what part of the neocortex is affected. Damage to the back of the head results in blindness, and damage to the left side could lead to loss of language.

In 1991, two scientists, Daniel Felleman and David Van Essen, combined data from dozens of separate studies to create a famous illustration of the macaque monkey’s neocortex. Here is one of the images that they created (a map of a human’s neocortex would be different in detail, but similar in overall structure). Connections in the neocortex The dozens of small rectangles in this picture represent the different regions of the neocortex, and the lines represent how information flows from one region to another via the white matter. A common interpretation of this image is that the neocortex is hierarchical, like a flowchart. Input from the senses enters at the bottom (in this diagram, input from the skin is on the left and input from the eyes is on the right). The input is processed in a series of steps, each of which extracts more and more complex features from the input. For example, the first region that gets input from the eyes might detect simple patterns such as lines or edges. This information is sent to the next region, which might detect more complex features such as corners or shapes. This stepwise process continues until some regions detect complete objects.

The second observation from these images was that most of the connections between neurons run vertically, between layers. Neurons have treelike appendages called axons and dendrites that allow them to send information to each other. Cajal saw that most of the axons ran between layers, perpendicular to the surface of the neocortex (up and down in the images here). Neurons in some layers make long-distance horizontal connections, but most of the connections are vertical. This means that information arriving in a region of the neocortex moves mostly up and down between the layers before being sent elsewhere.

For a long time, it was believed that information entered the neocortex via the “sensory regions,” went up and down the hierarchy of regions, and finally went down to the “motor region.” Cells in the motor region project to neurons in the spinal cord that move the muscles and limbs. We now know this description is misleading. In every region they have examined, scientists have found cells that project to some part of the old brain related to movement. For example, the visual regions that get input from the eyes send a signal down to the part of the old brain responsible for moving the eyes. Similarly, the auditory regions that get input from the ears project to the part of the old brain that moves the head. Moving your head changes what you hear, similar to how moving your eyes changes what you see. The evidence we have indicates that the complex circuitry seen everywhere in the neocortex performs a sensory-motor task. There are no pure motor regions and no pure sensory regions. In summary, the neocortex is the organ of intelligence. It is a napkin-size sheet of neural tissue divided into dozens of regions. There are regions responsible for vision, hearing, touch, and language. There are regions that are not as easily labeled that are responsible for high-level thought and planning. The regions are connected to each other with bundles of nerve fibers. Some of the connections between the regions are hierarchical, suggesting that information flows from region to region in an orderly fashion like a flowchart. But there are other connections between the regions that seem to have little order, suggesting that information goes all over at once. All regions, no matter what function they perform, look similar in detail to all other regions.

However, Mountcastle goes on to say that while much of the brain got bigger by adding new parts on top of old parts, that is not how the neocortex grew to occupy 70 percent of our brain. The neocortex got big by making many copies of the same thing: a basic circuit. Imagine watching a video of our brain evolving. The brain starts small. A new piece appears at one end, then another piece appears on top of that, and then another piece is appended on top of the previous pieces. At some point, millions of years ago, a new piece appears that we now call the neocortex. The neocortex starts small, but then grows larger, not by creating anything new, but by copying a basic circuit over and over. As the neocortex grows, it gets larger in area but not in thickness. Mountcastle argued that, although a human neocortex is much larger than a rat or dog neocortex, they are all made of the same element—we just have more copies of that element.

In these two sentences, Mountcastle summarizes the major idea put forth in his essay. He says that every part of the neocortex works on the same principle. All the things we think of as intelligence—from seeing, to touching, to language, to high-level thought—are fundamentally the same.

Mountcastle proposed that the reason the regions look similar is that they are all doing the same thing. What makes them different is not their intrinsic function but what they are connected to. If you connect a cortical region to eyes, you get vision; if you connect the same cortical region to ears, you get hearing; and if you connect regions to other regions, you get higher thought, such as language. Mountcastle then points out that if we can discover the basic function of any part of the neocortex, we will understand how the entire thing works.

So, what was Mountcastle’s proposal for the location of the cortical algorithm? He said that the fundamental unit of the neocortex, the unit of intelligence, was a “cortical column.” Looking at the surface of the neocortex, a cortical column occupies about one square millimeter. It extends through the entire 2.5 mm thickness, giving it a volume of 2.5 cubic millimeters. By this definition, there are roughly 150,000 cortical columns stacked side by side in a human neocortex. You can imagine a cortical column is like a little piece of thin spaghetti. A human neocortex is like 150,000 short pieces of spaghetti stacked vertically next to each other.

Cortical columns are not visible under a microscope. With a few exceptions, there are no visible boundaries between them. Scientists know they exist because all the cells in one column will respond to the same part of the retina, or the same patch of skin, but then cells in the next column will all respond to a different part of the retina or a different patch of skin. This grouping of responses is what defines a column. It is seen everywhere in the neocortex. Mountcastle pointed out that each column is further divided into several hundred “minicolumns.” If a cortical column is like a skinny strand of spaghetti, you can visualize minicolumns as even skinnier strands, like individual pieces of hair, stacked side by side inside the spaghetti strand. Each minicolumn contains a little over one hundred neurons spanning all layers. Unlike the larger cortical column, minicolumns are physically distinct and can often be seen with a microscope.

Finally, there is the argument of extreme flexibility. Humans can do many things for which there was no evolutionary pressure. For example, our brains did not evolve to program computers or make ice cream—both are recent inventions. The fact that we can do these things tells us that the brain relies on a general-purpose method of learning. To me, this last argument is the most compelling. Being able to learn practically anything requires the brain to work on a universal principle.

I was at home, working at my desk. There were dozens of objects on the desk and in the room. I realized that if any one of these objects changed, in even the slightest way, I would notice it. My pencil cup was always on the right side of the table; if one day I found it on the left, I would notice the change and wonder how it got moved. If the stapler changed in length, I would notice. I would notice the change if I touched the stapler or if I looked at it. I would even notice if the stapler made a different sound when being used. If the clock on the wall changed its location or style, I would notice. If the cursor on my computer screen moved left when I moved the mouse to the right, I would immediately realize something was wrong. What struck me was that I would notice these changes even if I wasn’t attending to these objects. As I looked around the room, I didn’t ask, “Is my stapler the correct length?” I didn’t think, “Check to make sure the clock’s hour hand is still shorter than the minute hand.” Changes to the normal would just pop into my head, and my attention would then be drawn to them. There were literally thousands of possible changes in my environment that my brain would notice almost instantly. There was only one explanation I could think of. My brain, specifically my neocortex, was making multiple simultaneous predictions of what it was about to see, hear, and feel. Every time I moved my eyes, my neocortex made predictions of what it was about to see. Every time I picked something up, my neocortex made predictions of what each finger should feel. And every action I took led to predictions of what I should hear. My brain predicted the smallest stimuli, such as the texture of the handle on my coffee cup, and large conceptual ideas, such as the correct month that should be displayed on a calendar. These predictions occurred in every sensory modality, for low-level sensory features and high-level concepts, which told me that every part of the neocortex, and therefore every cortical column, was making predictions. Prediction was a ubiquitous function of the neocortex.

Today I no longer use the phrase “the memory prediction framework.” Instead, I describe the same idea by saying that the neocortex learns a model of the world, and it makes predictions based on its model. I prefer the word “model” because it more precisely describes the kind of information that the neocortex learns. For example, my brain has a model of my stapler. The model of the stapler includes what the stapler looks like, what it feels like, and the sounds it makes when being used. The brain’s model of the world includes where objects are and how they change when we interact with them. For example, my model of the stapler includes how the top of the stapler moves relative to the bottom and how a staple comes out when the top is pressed down. These actions may seem simple, but you were not born with this knowledge. You learned it at some point in your life and now it is stored in your neocortex.

The brain creates a predictive model. This just means that the brain continuously predicts what its inputs will be. Prediction isn’t something that the brain does every now and then; it is an intrinsic property that never stops, and it serves an essential role in learning. When the brain’s predictions are verified, that means the brain’s model of the world is accurate. A mis-prediction causes you to attend to the error and update the model.

When you are born, your neocortex knows almost nothing. It doesn’t know any words, what buildings are like, how to use a computer, or what a door is and how it moves on hinges. It has to learn countless things. The overall structure of the neocortex is not random. Its size, the number of regions it has, and how they are connected together is largely determined by our genes. For example, genes determine what parts of the neocortex are connected to the eyes, what other parts are connected to the ears, and how those parts connect to each other. Therefore, we can say that the neocortex is structured at birth to see, hear, and even learn language. But it is also true that the neocortex doesn’t know what it will see, what it will hear, and what specific languages it might learn. We can think of the neocortex as starting life having some built-in assumptions about the world but knowing nothing in particular. Through experience, it learns a rich and complicated model of the world.

The inputs to the brain are constantly changing. There are two reasons why. First, the world can change. For example, when listening to music, the inputs from the ears change rapidly, reflecting the movement of the music. Similarly, a tree swaying in the breeze will lead to visual and perhaps auditory changes. In these two examples, the inputs to the brain are changing from moment to moment, not because you are moving but because things in the world are moving and changing on their own. The second reason is because we move. Every time we take a step, move a limb, move our eyes, tilt our head, or utter a sound, the input from our sensors change. For example, our eyes make rapid movements, called saccades, about three times a second. With each saccade, our eyes fixate on a new point in the world and the information from the eyes to the brain changes completely. This change would not occur if we hadn’t moved our eyes. The brain learns its model of the world by observing how its inputs change over time. There isn’t another way to learn. Unlike with a computer, we cannot upload a file into our brain. The only way for a brain to learn anything is via changes in its inputs. If the inputs to the brain were static, nothing could be learned.

Some things, like a melody, can be learned without moving the body. We can sit perfectly still, with eyes closed, and learn a new melody by just listening to how the sounds change over time. But most learning requires that we actively move and explore. Imagine you enter a new house, one you have not been in before. If you don’t move, there will be no changes in your sensory input, and you can’t possibly learn anything about the house. To learn a model of the house, you have to look in different directions and walk from room to room. You need to open doors, peek in drawers, and pick up objects. The house and its contents are mostly static; they don’t move on their own. To learn a model of a house, you have to move.

With each movement, the neocortex predicts what the next sensation will be. Move my finger up on the coffee cup and I expect to feel the lip, move my finger sideways and I expect to feel the handle. If I turn my head left when entering my kitchen, I expect to see my refrigerator, and if I turn my head right, I expect to see the range. If I move my eyes to the left front burner, I expect to see the broken igniter that I need to fix. If any input doesn’t match the brain’s prediction—perhaps my spouse fixed the igniter—then my attention is drawn to the area of mis-prediction. This alerts the neocortex that its model of that part of the world needs to be updated.

The brain’s cells, called neurons, are in many ways similar to all our other cells. For example, a neuron has a cell membrane that defines its boundary and a nucleus that contains DNA. However, neurons have several unique properties that don’t exist in other cells in your body. The first is that neurons look like trees. They have branch-like extensions of the cell membrane, called axons and dendrites. The dendrite branches are clustered near the cell and collect the inputs. The axon is the output. It makes many connections to nearby neurons but often travels long distances, such as from one side of the brain to the other or from the neocortex all the way down to the spinal cord.

The third unique property is that the axon of one neuron makes connections to the dendrites of other neurons. The connection points are called synapses. When a spike traveling along an axon reaches a synapse, it releases a chemical that enters the dendrite of the receiving neuron. Depending on which chemical is released, it makes the receiving neuron more or less likely to generate its own spike.

At any point in time, some neurons in the neocortex are actively spiking and some are not. Typically, the number of neurons that are active at the same time is small, maybe 2 percent. Your thoughts and perceptions are determined by which neurons are spiking. For example, when doctors perform brain surgery, they sometimes need to activate neurons in an awake patient’s brain. They stick a tiny probe into the neocortex and use electricity to activate a few neurons. When they do this, the patient might hear, see, or think something. When the doctor stops the stimulation, whatever the patient was experiencing stops. If the doctor activates different neurons, the patient has a different thought or perception. Thoughts and experiences are always the result of a set of neurons that are active at the same time. Individual neurons can participate in many different thoughts or experiences. Every thought you have is the activity of neurons. Everything you see, hear, or feel is also the activity of neurons. Our mental states and the activity of neurons are one and the same.

Here is the basic idea for how the brain learns: Each neuron has thousands of synapses, which connect the neuron to thousands of other neurons. If two neurons spike at the same time, they will strengthen the connection between them. When we learn something, the connections are strengthened, and when we forget something, the connections are weakened. This basic idea was proposed by Donald Hebb in the 1940s and today it is referred to as Hebbian learning.

However, over the past few decades, scientists have discovered that in many parts of the brain, including the neocortex, new synapses form and old ones disappear. Every day, many of the synapses on an individual neuron will disappear and new ones will replace them. Thus, much of learning occurs by forming new connections between neurons that were previously not connected. Forgetting happens when old or unused connections are removed entirely.

This discovery led to an important question. How does the brain make predictions? One potential answer is that the brain has two types of neurons: neurons that fire when the brain is actually seeing something, and neurons that fire when the brain is predicting it will see something. To avoid hallucinating, the brain needs to keep its predictions separate from reality. Using two sets of neurons does this nicely. However, there are two problems with this idea. First, given that the neocortex is making a massive number of predictions at every moment, we would expect to find a large number of prediction neurons. So far, that hasn’t been observed. Scientists have found some neurons that become active in advance of an input, but these neurons are not as common as we would expect. The second problem is based on an observation that had long bothered me. If the neocortex is making hundreds or thousands of predictions at any moment in time, why are we not aware of most of these predictions? If I grab a cup with my hand, I am not aware that my brain is predicting what each finger should feel, unless I feel something unusual—say, a crack. We are not consciously aware of most of the predictions made by the brain unless an error occurs. Trying to understand how the neurons in the neocortex make predictions led to the second discovery.

Predicting the next note in a melody, also known as sequence memory, is the simpler of the two problems, so we worked on it first. Sequence memory is used for a lot more than just learning melodies; it is also used in creating behaviors. For example, when I dry myself off with a towel after showering, I typically follow a nearly identical pattern of movements, which is a form of sequence memory. Sequence memory is also used in language. Recognizing a spoken word is like recognizing a short melody. The word is defined by a sequence of phonemes, whereas a melody is defined by a sequence of musical intervals.

For example, melodies often have repeating sections, such as a chorus or the da da da dum of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. To predict the next note, you can’t just look at the previous note or the previous five notes. The correct prediction may rely on notes that occurred a long time ago. Neurons have to figure out how much context is necessary to make the right prediction. Another requirement is that neurons have to play Name That Tune. The first few notes you hear might belong to several different melodies. The neurons have to keep track of all possible melodies consistent with what has been heard so far, until enough notes have been heard to eliminate all but one melody.

A typical neuron Above is a picture of the most common type of neuron in the neocortex. Neurons like this have thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of synapses spaced along the branches of the dendrites. Some of the dendrites are near the cell body (which is toward the bottom of the image), and some dendrites are farther away (toward the top). The box shows an enlarged view of one dendrite branch so you can see how small and tightly packed the synapses are. Each bump along the dendrite is one synapse. I’ve also highlighted an area around the cell body; the synapses in this area are called proximal synapses. If the proximal synapses receive enough input, then the neuron will spike. The spike starts at the cell body and travels to other neurons via the axon. The axon was not visible in this picture, so I added a down-facing arrow to show where it would be. If you just consider the proximal synapses and the cell body, then this is the classic view of a neuron. If you have ever read about neurons or studied artificial neural networks, you will recognize this description. Oddly, less than 10 percent of the cell’s synapses are in the proximal area. The other 90 percent are too far away to cause a spike. If an input arrives at one of these distal synapses, like the ones shown in the box, it has almost no effect on the cell body. All that researchers could say was that the distal synapses performed some sort of modulatory role. For many years, no one knew what 90 percent of the synapses in the neocortex did. Starting around 1990, this picture changed. Scientists discovered new types of spikes that travel along the dendrites. Before, we knew of only one type of spike: it started at the cell body and traveled along the axon to reach other cells. Now, we’d learned that there were other spikes that traveled along the dendrites. One type of dendrite spike begins when a group of twenty or so synapses situated next to each other on a dendrite branch receive input at the same time. Once a dendrite spike is activated, it travels along the dendrite until it reaches the cell body. When it gets there, it raises the voltage of the cell, but not enough to make the neuron spike. It is like the dendrite spike is teasing the neuron—it is almost strong enough to make the neuron active, but not quite. The neuron stays in this provoked state for a little bit of time before going back to normal. Scientists were once again puzzled. What are dendrite spikes good for if they aren’t powerful enough to create a spike at the cell body? Not knowing what dendrite spikes are for, AI researchers use simulated neurons that don’t have them. They also don’t have dendrites and the many thousands of synapses found on the dendrites. I knew that distal synapses had to play an essential role in brain function. Any theory and any neural network that did not account for 90 percent of the synapses in the brain had to be wrong. The big insight I had was that dendrite spikes are predictions. A dendrite spike occurs when a set of synapses close to each other on a distal dendrite get input at the same time, and it means that the neuron has recognized a pattern of activity in some other neurons. When the pattern of activity is detected, it creates a dendrite spike, which raises the voltage at the cell body, putting the cell into what we call a predictive state. The neuron is then primed to spike. It is similar to how a runner who hears “Ready, set…” is primed to start running. If a neuron in a predictive state subsequently gets enough proximal input to create an action potential spike, then the cell spikes a little bit sooner than it would have if the neuron was not in a predictive state. Imagine there are ten neurons that all recognize the same pattern on their proximal synapses. This is like ten runners on a starting line, all waiting for the same signal to begin racing. One runner hears “Ready, set…” and anticipates the race is about to begin. She gets in the blocks and is primed to start. When the “go” signal is heard, she gets off the blocks sooner than the other runners who weren’t primed, who didn’t hear a preparatory signal. Upon seeing the first runner off to an early lead, the other runners give up and don’t even start. They wait for the next race. This kind of competition occurs throughout the neocortex. In each minicolumn, multiple neurons respond to the same input pattern. They are like the runners on the starting line, all waiting for the same signal. If their preferred input arrives, they all want to start spiking. However, if one or more of the neurons are in the predictive state, our theory says, only those neurons spike and the other neurons are inhibited. Thus, when an input arrives that is unexpected, multiple neurons fire at once. If the input is predicted, then only the predictive-state neurons become active. This is a common observation about the neocortex: unexpected inputs cause a lot more activity than expected ones. If you take several thousand neurons, arrange them in mini columns, let them make connections to each other, and add a few inhibitory neurons, they learn sequences. The neurons solve the Name That Tune problem, they don’t get confused by repeated subsequences, and, collectively, they predict the next element in the sequence. The trick to making this work was a new understanding of the neuron. We previously knew that prediction is a ubiquitous function of the brain. But we didn’t know how or where predictions are made. With this discovery, we understood that most predictions occur inside neurons. A prediction occurs when a neuron recognizes a pattern, creates a dendrite spike, and is primed to spike earlier than other neurons. With thousands of distal synapses, each neuron can recognize hundreds of patterns that predict when the neuron should become active. Prediction is built into the fabric of the neocortex, the neuron.

Notice that the brain needs to know where my finger is relative to the cup. It doesn’t matter where my finger is relative to my body, and it doesn’t matter where the cup is or how it is positioned. The cup can be tilted left or tilted right. It could be in front of me or off to the side. What matters is the location of my finger relative to the cup. This observation means there must be neurons in the neocortex that represent the location of my finger in a reference frame that is attached to the cup. The movement-related signal we had been searching for, the signal we needed to predict the next input, was “location on the object.”

Different parts of my body (fingertips, palm, lips) might touch the coffee cup at the same time. Each part of my body that touches the cup makes a separate prediction of what it will feel based on its unique location on the cup.

We started with the idea that the neocortex learns a rich and detailed model of the world, which it uses to constantly predict what its next sensory inputs will be. We then asked how neurons can make these predictions. This led us to a new theory that most predictions are represented by dendrite spikes that temporarily change the voltage inside a neuron and make a neuron fire a little bit sooner than it would otherwise. Predictions are not sent along the cell’s axon to other neurons, which explains why we are unaware of most of them. We then showed how circuits in the neocortex that use the new neuron model can learn and predict sequences. We applied this idea to the question of how such a circuit could predict the next sensory input when the inputs are changing due to our own movements. To make these sensory-motor predictions, we deduced that each cortical column must know the location of its input relative to the object being sensed. To do that, a cortical column requires a reference frame that is fixed to the object. CHAPTER 5 Maps in the Brain It took years for us to deduce that reference frames exist throughout the neocortex, but in hindsight, we could have understood this a long time ago with a simple observation. Right now, I am sitting in a small lounge area of Numenta’s office. Near me are three comfortable chairs similar to the one I am sitting in. Beyond the chairs are several freestanding desks. Beyond the desks, I see the old county courthouse across the street. Light from these objects enters my eyes and is projected onto the retina. Cells in the retina convert light into spikes. This is where vision starts, at the back of the eye. Why, then, do we not perceive objects as being in the eye? If the chairs, desks, and courthouse are imaged next to each other on my retina, how is it that I perceive them to be at different

The grid cells and place cells in my brain have created a map of my office, and they keep track of where I am in my office, even when my eyes are closed. As I walk, which cells are active changes to reflect my new location. Humans, rats, indeed all mammals use the same mechanism for knowing our location. We all have grid cells and place cells that create models of the places we have been.

When we were writing our 2017 paper about locations and reference frames in the neocortex, I had some knowledge of place cells and grid cells. It occurred to me that knowing the location of my finger relative to a coffee cup is similar to knowing the location of my body relative to a room. My finger moves around the cup in the same way that my body moves about a room. I realized that the neocortex might have neurons that are equivalent to the ones in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. These cortical place cells and cortical grid cells would learn models of objects in a similar way to how place cells and grid cells in the old brain learn models of environments.

Grid cells and place cells in the old brain mostly track the location of one thing: the body. They know where the body is in its current environment. The neocortex, on the other hand, has about 150,000 copies of this circuit, one per cortical column. Therefore, the neocortex tracks thousands of locations simultaneously. For example, each small patch of your skin and each small patch of your retina has its own reference frame in the neocortex. Your five fingertips touching a cup are like five rats exploring a box.

So, what does a model in the brain look like? How does the neocortex stuff hundreds of models into each square millimeter? To understand how this works, let’s go back to our paper-map analogy. Say I have a map of a town. I spread it out on a table and see that it is marked with rows and columns dividing it into one hundred squares. A1 is the top left and J10 is the bottom right. Printed in each square are things I might see in that part of town. I take a pair of scissors and cut out each square, marking it with its grid coordinates: B6, G1, etc. I also mark each square with Town 1. I then do the same for nine more maps, each map representing a different town. I now have one thousand squares: one hundred map squares for each of ten towns. I shuffle the squares and put them in a stack. Although my stack contains ten complete maps, only one location can be seen at a time. Now someone blindfolds me and drops me off at a random location in one of the ten towns. Removing my blindfold, I look around. At first, I don’t know where I am. Then I see I am standing in front of a fountain with a sculpture of a woman reading a book. I flip through my map squares, one at a time, until I see one showing this fountain. The map square is labeled Town 3, location D2. Now I know what town I am in and I know where I am in that town. There are several things I can do next. For example, I can predict what I will see if I start walking. My current location is D2. If I walk east, I will be in D3. I search my stack of squares to find the square labeled Town 3, D3. It shows a playground. In this way I can predict what I will encounter if I move in a certain direction. Perhaps I want to go to the town library. I can search my stack of squares until I see one showing a library in Town 3. That square is labeled G7. Given that I am at D2, I can calculate that I have to travel three squares east and five squares south to get to the library. I can take several different routes to get there. Using my map squares, one at a time, I can visualize what I will encounter along any particular route. I choose one that takes me past an ice cream shop. Now consider a different scenario. After being dropped off at an unknown location and removing my blindfold, I see a coffee shop. But when I look through my stack of squares, I find five showing a similar-looking coffee shop. Two coffee shops are in one town, and the other three are in different towns. I could be in any of these five locations. What should I do? I can eliminate the ambiguity by moving. I look at the five squares where I might be, and then look up what I will see if I walk south from each of them. The answer is different for each of the five squares. To figure out where I am, I then physically walk south. What I find there eliminates my uncertainty. I now know where I am. This way of using maps is different than how we typically use them. First, our stack of map squares contains all our maps. In this way, we use the stack to figure out both what town we are in and where we are in that town. Second, if we are uncertain where we are, then we can determine our town and location by moving. This is what happens when you reach into a black box and touch an unknown object with one finger. With a single touch you probably can’t determine what object you are feeling. You might have to move your finger one or more times to make that determination. By moving, you discover two things at the same time: the moment you recognize what object you are touching, you also know where your finger is on the object. Finally, this system can scale to handle a large number of maps and do so quickly. In the paper-map analogy, I described looking at the map squares one at a time. This could take a lot of time if you had many maps. Neurons, however, use what is called associative memory. The details are not important here, but it allows neurons to search though all the map squares at once. Neurons take the same amount of time to search through a thousand maps as to search through one.

Now let’s consider how maplike models are implemented by neurons in the neocortex. Our theory says that every cortical column can learn models of complete objects. Therefore, every column—every square millimeter of the neocortex—has its own set of map squares. How a cortical column does this is complicated, and we don’t yet understand it completely, but we understand the basics. Recall that a cortical column has multiple layers of neurons. Several of these layers are needed to create the map squares. Here is a simplified diagram to give you a flavor of what we think is happening in a cortical column. A model of a cortical column This figure represents two layers of neurons (the shaded boxes) in one cortical column. Although a column is tiny, about one millimeter wide, each of these layers might have ten thousand neurons. The upper layer receives the sensory input to the column. When an input arrives, it causes several hundred neurons to become active. In the paper-map analogy, the upper layer represents what you observe at some location, such as the fountain. The bottom layer represents the current location in a reference frame. In the analogy, the lower layer represents a location—such as Town 3, D2—but doesn’t represent what is observed there. It is like a blank square, labeled only with Town 3, location D2. The two vertical arrows represent connections between the blank map squares (the lower layer) and what is seen at that location (the upper layer). The downward arrow is how an observed feature, such as the fountain, is associated with a particular location in a particular town. The upward arrow associates a particular location—Town 3, D2—with an observed feature. The upper layer is roughly equivalent to place cells and the lower layer is roughly equivalent to grid cells.

Learning a new object, such as a coffee cup, is mostly accomplished by learning the connections between the two layers, the vertical arrows. Put another way, an object such as a coffee cup is defined by a set of observed features (upper layer) associated with a set of locations on the cup (lower layer). If you know the feature, then you can determine the location. If you know the location, you can predict the feature.
